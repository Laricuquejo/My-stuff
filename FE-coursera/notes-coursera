2.Rocky II
3.Rocky III
A <div> tag defines a content division in a HTML document. It acts as a generic container and has no effect on the content unless it is styled by CSS.
If you want to leave a comment in the code for other developers, it can be added as:
  <!-- This is a comment --> 
<a> = this tag works just like an anchor, it links your actual webpage with another webpage:
<a href="location.html">Our location</a>
<img src="" width="" height="" alt=""> = to put an image. 
How can I do a table?
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Dish</th>
    <th>Price</th>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Falafel</td>
    <td>$10.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pasta Salad</td>
    <td>$12.00</td>

CSS:
The example below selects all p elements that have the CSS class introduction applied to them.
<p class="introduction"></a>
  
p.introduction { 
  margin: 2px;
}

Descendant selectors are useful if you need to select HTML elements that are contained within another selector.
<div id="blog">
  <h1>Latest News</h1>
  <div>
    <h1>Today's Weather</h1>
    <p>The weather will be sunny</p>
  </div>
  <p>Subscribe for more news</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>Archives</h1>
</div>

#blog h1 {
  color: blue;
}

Child selectors are more specific than descendant selectors. They only select elements that are immediate descendants (children) of a selector (the parent).

<div id="blog">
  <h1>Latest News</h1>
  <div>
    <h1>Today's Weather</h1>
    <p>The weather will be sunny</p>
  </div>
  <p>Subscribe for more news</p>
</div>

#blog > h1 {
  color: blue;
}
The simplest example of this is changing the color of a hyperlink when it is hovered over. To do this, you add the :hover pseudo-class to the end of the selector. In the following example, adding :hover  to the a element will change the color of the hyperlink to orange when it is hovered over.
a:hover {
  color: orange;
}

To set the font used by text in CSS you use the font-family property.

To set the size of the font, the font-size property is used.

The most commonly used values for the text-transform property are:  uppercase,  lowercase,  capitalize 
text-decoration = underlining or line-trough.
You can set thickness with:
text-decoration: underline red solid 5px;
text-decoration-style  property;  solid,  double,  dotted,  dashed  and  wavy.

*****alignment basics week2*****
Document flow is the arrangement of page elements, as defined by CSS positioning statements, and the order of HTML elements.
Text alignment can be set to left, right, center and justify.

The justify alignment spreads the text out so that every line of the text has the same width.
It is important to note that this works because the div element is a block-level element.  

If you want to align an inline element like img, you will need to change it to a block-level element. Similar to the div example, you add the img to a parent element.
HTML element alignment is more complicated than text alignment. To align HTML elements, you must consider the box model and document flow from previous lessons. Aligning an HTML element is done by changing the properties of its box model and how it impacts the document flow.
The float property sets an element's position relative to the text content within a parent element. Text will wrap around the element.

Bootstrap:
Bootstrap is a library of CSS and JavaScript code that you can combine to quickly build visually appealing websites.
How to add a css librarie:

3 things to do a website responsive:

* flexible grids

* fluid images

*  media queries

Flexible grids:
are made of columns, gutters (space between the columns) and margins.

Fluid images:
max-width: 100%

Media queries:
Display size, orientation, aspect ratio.

Breakpoint:
Fixed grid, Fluid grid, Hybrid grid.

Extra small < 576px
Small(class infix = sm) >=576px
Medium (class infix = md) >= 768px
Large (class infix = lg) >= 992px
Extra large xl (class infix = xl) >= 1200pxl
Extra extra large (class infix = xxl) >= 1400pxl

Other CSS frameworks and libraries

Foundation: is a framework for building user interfaces similar to Bootstrap. It is used by many large companies such as Pixar, Polar and Sonos. One prominent feature of Foundation is that it can be used to style content for sending via email.

Pure.css: Pure.css is another library for building user interfaces. While it doesn't have as many features as Bootstrap, it is designed to be minimal in file size. Smaller file sizes improve loading times for web pages as there is less data to transfer from the web server. If your next project is focused on minimal loading time, this library is worth considering.

Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework that uses a utility-based approach for its CSS rules. This means that the framework provides many CSS classes with a single purpose. For example, the CSS class pt-6 sets the padding-top CSS property to 6 pixels. This means that you can be precise in applying styling to your HTML without writing CSS. The advantage to this is that it is more flexible for customizing your webpage's design using the framework. However, the disadvantage is that if multiple developers are working on a project, it could lead to inconsistent design if the team is not strict on its design rules.

UIKit: UIKit is a lightweight CSS framework featuring a small set of responsive components. Its simple design allows developers to easily customize the style rules and visuals.

MVP.css: MVP.css is a small CSS library that automatically styles HTML elements without needing to apply CSS classes to them. The library aims to allow a developer to quickly prototype a user interface without worrying about the final design, while still being visually appealing. MVP comes from the technical term Minimal Viable Product, a product with sufficient features to demo to customers or other business stakeholders.
