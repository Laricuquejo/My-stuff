If you want to leave a comment in the code for other developers, it can be added as:
  <!-- This is a comment --> 
<a> = this tag works just like an anchor, it links your actual webpage with another webpage:
<a href="location.html">Our location</a>
<img src="" width="" height="" alt=""> = to put an image.

Descendant selectors are useful if you need to select HTML elements that are contained within another selector.
<div id="blog">
  <h1>Latest News</h1>
  <div>
    <h1>Today's Weather</h1>
    <p>The weather will be sunny</p>
  </div>
  <p>Subscribe for more news</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>Archives</h1>
</div>

#blog h1 {
  color: blue;
}

Child selectors are more specific than descendant selectors. They only select elements that are immediate descendants (children) of a selector (the parent).

<div id="blog">
  <h1>Latest News</h1>
  <div>
    <h1>Today's Weather</h1>
    <p>The weather will be sunny</p>
  </div>
  <p>Subscribe for more news</p>
</div>

#blog > h1 {
  color: blue;
}
The simplest example of this is changing the color of a hyperlink when it is hovered over. To do this, you add the :hover pseudo-class to the end of the selector. In the following example, adding :hover  to the a element will change the color of the hyperlink to orange when it is hovered over.
a:hover {
  color: orange;
}

To set the font used by text in CSS you use the font-family property.

To set the size of the font, the font-size property is used.

The most commonly used values for the text-transform property are:  uppercase,  lowercase,  capitalize 
text-decoration = underlining or line-trough.
You can set thickness with:
text-decoration: underline red solid 5px;
text-decoration-style  property;  solid,  double,  dotted,  dashed  and  wavy.
