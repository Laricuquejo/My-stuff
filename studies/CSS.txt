 - Cascading Style Sheets.
 - CSS defines exactly how HTML looks like.
 - HTML is content and CSS is style.
 - There are three ways to use CSS:
 1. CSS code inside an HTML tag; <p style="font-size": 120%">
 2. CSS code inside an HTML document;  <style> p {font-size: 120%} </style>
 3. CSS code in external file; p {font-size: 120% }
 -We use the link tag in the HTML head; <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
 - CSS is written in rules. Each ruleconsists of a selector,and a declaration block.
 - If you want change the text color; (for example) h1 { color: blue }.
 - If you want change the size;(for example) h1 { font-size: 40px }.
 - If you want change the font family; (for example) h2 { font-family: Helvetica neue}, if that  font is not avaliable on
your system, you need to put Arial;  h2 { font-family: Helvetica neue, Arial}
 - If you want equalize the text letter with the link; body {""}
 - If you want to style only one of the paragraphs, not all them, we can attribute class or ID name to elements;
<p class="">, <p id="">
      :           : 
      V           V    
."name" {}           #"name" {}
 - If you want to leave everything without margins or padding; * { margin: 0;
                                                                  padding: 0;
                                                                  box-sizing: border-box; }
 - If you want space between one element and other; (for example) h2 { margin-bottom: 20px}.
 - <div> stands for divide.
 - for adjust the widht and margin, you have to create a class 
and give a name for it and then you go and out these tag:
.container { widht : 1140;
            margin-left: auto;
            margin-right: auto;}.
 - To put color in the wallpaper, you have to create a class
and then you go and out these tag; ."" { background-color: }
 - If you want to put something in the left side you must adjust the widht and then you go and out these tag.
."" {widht: 25%;
     float: left;}
 - the tag {text-rendering: optimizelegibility;} this will make our fonts rendering in a perfect way.
 - To put a background image you have to put this 
  header {
         background-image: url(img/your file);
         background-size: cover;
         background-position: center;
         height: 100vh;
  }
 - To put the box in the middle you have to put this
 ."name of your class" {
    position: absolute;
    width: 1140px;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
 }
 - To put buttons you have to create a class:
 .btn ̣̣̣̣̣̣̣{
 display: inline-block;
    padding: 10px 30px;
    font-weight: 300;
    text-decoration: none;
    border-radius: 200px;
    color: #fff
 }
- The tag display: inline-block it's  to put the things side by side.
- The h2 after it's just some stuff that will apear after the h2.
- the tag li is to put some links:
.name-of-your-class li {

}
-To make the images look the same size you have to set a maximum height with pixels.
 ex: height: 200px;
 -To have a cool effect, you have to add :hover and put the following tags;
ex: .name-of-your-class img:hover {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1.03);
}
but before you have to put this;
.name-of-your-class img {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    transform: scale(1.15);
    transition: transform 0.5s, opacity 0.5s;
}
-If you want to make a circle you have to use this;
ex:  border-radius: 50%;
- clearfix is to clear the floats.
-Secrets to align text and icons:
line-height: 120%;
vertical-align: middle;
margin-top: -2px;
-To put a background:
 background-image: url(link).
 To put an effect to make the image stays in the same place and while we scroll it down, you can see the rest of the image, you need to put this;
 background-attachment: fixed.
-Media queries:

/* Big tablet to 1200px (widths smaller that the 1140px row) */
@media only screen and (max-width: 1023px) {


}

/* Small tablets to big tablets: from 768px to 1023px */
@media only screen and (max-width: 1023px) {
   


}

/* Small phones to small tablets: from 481px to 767px */
@media only screen and (max-width: 767px) {


}


/* Small phones: from 0 to 480px */
@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {

}

- With the property fixed, the navigation stays always at the same point of our scrolling.
     position: fixed;
