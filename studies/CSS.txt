- Cascading Style Sheets.
- CSS defines exactly how HTML looks like.
- HTML is content and CSS is style.
- There are three ways to use CSS:
1. CSS code inside an HTML tag; <p style="font-size": 120%">
2. CSS code inside an HTML document;  <style> p {font-size: 120%} </style>
3. CSS code in external file; p {font-size: 120% }
-We use the link tag in the HTML head; <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
- CSS is written in rules. Each ruleconsists of a selector,and a declaration block.
- If you want change the text color; (for example) h1 { color: blue }.
- If you want change the size;(for example) h1 { font-size: 40px }.
- If you want change the font family; (for example) h2 { font-family: Helvetica neue}, if that font is not avaliable on
your system, you need to put Arial;  h2 { font-family: Helvetica neue, Arial}
- If you want equalize the text letter with the link; body {""}
- If you want to style only one of the paragraphs, not all them, we can attribute class or ID name to elements;
<p class="">, <p id="">
      :           : 
      V           V    
."name" {}           #"name" {}
- If you want to leave everything without margins or padding; * { margin: 0;
                                                                  padding: 0;
                                                                  box-sizing: border-box; }
- If you want space between one element and other; (for example) h2 { margin-bottom: 20px}.
- <div> stands for divide.
- for adjust the widht and margin, you have to create a class 
and give a name for it and then you go and out these tag:
.container { widht : 1140;
            margin-left: auto;
            margin-right: auto;}.
- For put color in the wallpaper, you have to create a class
and then you go and out these tag; ."" { background-color: }
- If you want to put something in the left side you must adjust the widht and then you go and out these tag.
."" {widht: 25%;
     float: left;}
