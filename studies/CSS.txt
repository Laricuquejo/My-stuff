 - Cascading Style Sheets.
 - CSS defines exactly how HTML looks like.
 - HTML is content and CSS is style.
 - There are three ways to use CSS:
 1. CSS code inside an HTML tag; <p style="font-size": 120%">
 2. CSS code inside an HTML document;  <style> p {font-size: 120%} </style>
 3. CSS code in external file; p {font-size: 120% }
 -We use the link tag in the HTML head; <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
 - CSS is written in rules. Each ruleconsists of a selector,and a declaration block.
 - If you want change the text color; (for example) h1 { color: blue }.
 - If you want change the size;(for example) h1 { font-size: 40px }.
 - If you want change the font family; (for example) h2 { font-family: Helvetica neue}, if that  font is not avaliable on
your system, you need to put Arial;  h2 { font-family: Helvetica neue, Arial}
 - If you want equalize the text letter with the link; body {""}
 - If you want to style only one of the paragraphs, not all them, we can attribute class or ID name to elements;
<p class="">, <p id="">
      :           : 
      V           V    
."name" {}           #"name" {}
 - If you want to leave everything without margins or padding; * { margin: 0;
                                                                  padding: 0;
                                                                  box-sizing: border-box; }
 - If you want space between one element and other; (for example) h2 { margin-bottom: 20px}.
 - <div> stands for divide.
 - for adjust the widht and margin, you have to create a class 
and give a name for it and then you go and out these tag:
.container { widht : 1140;
            margin-left: auto;
            margin-right: auto;}.
 - For put color in the wallpaper, you have to create a class
and then you go and out these tag; ."" { background-color: }
 - If you want to put something in the left side you must adjust the widht and then you go and out these tag.
."" {widht: 25%;
     float: left;}
 - the tag {text-rendering: optimizelegibility;} this will make our fonts rendering in a perfect way.
 - To put a background image you have to put this 
  header {
         background-image: url(img/your file);
         background-size: cover;
         background-position: center;
         height: 100vh;
  }
 - To put the box in the middle you have to put this
 ."name of your class" {
    position: absolute;
    width: 1140px;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
 }
 - To put buttons you have to create a class:
 .btn ̣̣̣̣̣̣̣{
 display: inline-block;
    padding: 10px 30px;
    font-weight: 300;
    text-decoration: none;
    border-radius: 200px;
    color: #fff
 }
- The tag display: inline-block it's  to put the things side by side.
- The h2 after it's just some stuff that will apear after the h2.
- the tag li is to put some links:
.idk li {

}
-To make the images look the same size you have to set a maximum height with pixels.
 ex: height: 200px;
