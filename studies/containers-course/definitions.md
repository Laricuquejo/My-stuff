Bare Metal: No virtualizaton - the application or service is deployed directly onto the machine.

Virtual Machines: The hardware is virtualized so multiple operating systems can be isolated on the machine.

Container: Virtualized operating system - libraries and applications are isolated within their own namespace.

Benefits of containers: quicker than VMs and Bare Metal, consistent, simple
 
Elastic Architectures: 

* Monitor Containers: Monitor CPU, memory, data, and other metrics. When certain metrics are met --> Scale Out (Use automation to add containers as certain load metrics are reached) 

*Scale in: Alternatively, when things slow down, remove containers and save resources.
