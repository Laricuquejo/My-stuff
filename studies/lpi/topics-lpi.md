Hard disks: is like a digital filing cabinet for your computer, storing your files and data on spinning disks using magnetic technology.
 
 Solid State Disk (SSD): is a storage device that uses flash memory to store data, offering fast access times and high-speed data transfer compared to traditional hard disk drives (HDDs).

Differences: 
Technology:
HDD: Hard disks use magnetic storage technology with spinning disks and moving read/write heads.
SSD: Solid-state disks use flash memory technology, similar to USB drives or memory cards, without any moving parts.
Speed:
HDD: Hard disks are slower because they rely on mechanical parts to read and write data.
SSD: Solid-state disks are much faster since they have no moving parts and can access data almost instantly.
Durability:
HDD: Hard disks are more prone to damage from physical shocks and vibrations due to their mechanical nature.
SSD: Solid-state disks are more durable because they have no moving parts, making them better suited for mobile devices or environments with lots of movement.
Noise and Heat:
HDD: Hard disks can generate noise and heat as the spinning disks and moving parts operate.
SSD: Solid-state disks are silent and produce less heat since they have no moving parts.
Power Consumption:
HDD: Hard disks require more power to operate because of the moving parts.
SSD: Solid-state disks consume less power, which can result in longer battery life for laptops and lower energy costs for desktops.
Price:
HDD: Hard disks are generally cheaper per gigabyte of storage compared to SSDs.
SSD: Solid-state disks are typically more expensive but offer better performance and durability.
DNS stands for Domain Name System. It's like the internet's phone book. When you type a website's domain name (like example.com) into your web browser, your computer needs to find out the numerical address (IP address) associated with that domain name to connect to the website's server. DNS servers are responsible for translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses and vice versa.

In simpler terms, DNS helps your computer find the right website when you type in its name. It's a crucial part of how the internet works, ensuring that you can easily access websites using their domain names instead of having to remember a long string of numbers for each site.
