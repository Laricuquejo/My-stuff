Hard disks: is like a digital filing cabinet for your computer, storing your files and data on spinning disks using magnetic technology.
 
 Solid State Disk (SSD): is a storage device that uses flash memory to store data, offering fast access times and high-speed data transfer compared to traditional hard disk drives (HDDs).

Differences: 
Technology:
HDD: Hard disks use magnetic storage technology with spinning disks and moving read/write heads.
SSD: Solid-state disks use flash memory technology, similar to USB drives or memory cards, without any moving parts.
Speed:
HDD: Hard disks are slower because they rely on mechanical parts to read and write data.
SSD: Solid-state disks are much faster since they have no moving parts and can access data almost instantly.
Durability:
HDD: Hard disks are more prone to damage from physical shocks and vibrations due to their mechanical nature.
SSD: Solid-state disks are more durable because they have no moving parts, making them better suited for mobile devices or environments with lots of movement.
Noise and Heat:
HDD: Hard disks can generate noise and heat as the spinning disks and moving parts operate.
SSD: Solid-state disks are silent and produce less heat since they have no moving parts.
Power Consumption:
HDD: Hard disks require more power to operate because of the moving parts.
SSD: Solid-state disks consume less power, which can result in longer battery life for laptops and lower energy costs for desktops.
Price:
HDD: Hard disks are generally cheaper per gigabyte of storage compared to SSDs.
SSD: Solid-state disks are typically more expensive but offer better performance and durability.
