# Understanding Relative and Absolute Paths
    ### Overview
        In computing, particularly in the context of file systems, there are two types of paths used to locate files and directories: relative paths and absolute paths. This README aims to provide a clear understanding of the differences between these two types of paths and when to use each.

    # Relative Paths
        A relative path specifies the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory. This means that the path is described in relation to the directory you're currently in.

    ### Example:
        If our current working directory is /home/user/documents/ and we want to access a file named report.txt located in a subdirectory called projects, the relative path would be: projects/report.txt.

    ### Usage:
        Relative paths are commonly used when referring to files or directories within the same project or directory structure. They provide flexibility and ease of use, especially when moving the project to different locations within the file system.

    # Absolute Paths
        An absolute path provides the complete path from the root directory to the specified file or directory. It gives the full location of a file or directory in the file system hierarchy.

    ### Example:
        If the file report.txt is located at /home/user/documents/projects/report.txt, the absolute path would be: /home/user/documents/projects/report.txt.

    ### Usage:
        Absolute paths are used when you need to specify the exact location of a file or directory regardless of the current working directory. They provide a fixed reference point, ensuring that the file or directory can be located consistently.

    ### Conclusion
        Understanding the differences between relative and absolute paths is essential for effectively navigating and referencing files and directories within a file system. By using relative paths for internal references within a project and absolute paths for fixed references across different projects or systems, you can ensure clarity and consistency in file management.
