# Introduction:

Linux, conceived by Linus Torvalds in 1991, is a highly popular operating system inspired by Unix. It was developed to cater to the needs of computing on the x86 platform, filling a gap left by Unix's unavailability on affordable hardware. While Linux shares fundamental principles with Unix, it is an independent project maintained by a global community of programmers. Its open-source nature permits unrestricted usage, rendering it accessible to a wide range of users.

# Distributions:

Linux distributions bundle a kernel and applications, tailored by companies or communities for specific purposes. They often include tools for installation and administration. Debian-based distributions, like Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu, prioritize reliability and user freedom. Red Hat's offerings, RHEL and CentOS, cater to enterprise needs, with RHEL offering commercial support. Fedora serves as a desktop-focused testbed for new technologies. SUSE provides SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and openSUSE. Independent distributions target specialized needs, like security (QubesOS) and penetration testing (Kali Linux). Additionally, distributions exist for embedded systems and containerization (Docker).

# Embedded Systems:

Embedded systems integrate hardware and software for specific functions within larger systems, commonly found in automotive, medical, and military applications. Linux-based operating systems are prevalent due to their versatility, offering advantages such as cross-platform compatibility, robust development, and absence of licensing fees. Popular projects include Android for mobile devices and Raspbian for Raspberry Pi.

# Android:

Android, developed by Google, is a mobile operating system based on a modified Linux kernel. It offers an intuitive interface, extensive developer community, and hardware support, making it ideal for embedded devices.

# Raspbian and Raspberry Pi:

Raspberry Pi, a low-cost computer developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, is popular for educational and DIY projects. It runs Raspbian, a Debian-based distribution optimized for Raspberry Pi, offering numerous packages and hardware attachment capabilities via GPIO pins.

# Linux in the Cloud:

Linux powers around 90% of public cloud workloads, with major providers offering Linux-based services through Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Users select Linux distributions from pre-configured images provided by cloud providers, often with additional tools for seamless integration.

# Exercises:

1. How is Debian GNU/Linux different from Ubuntu? Name two aspects.

Ubuntu and Debian GNU/Linux share similarities as Ubuntu is based on a snapshot of Debian. However, significant differences exist between them. Firstly, Ubuntu is recommended for beginners due to its user-friendly interface, while Debian is favored by advanced users for its configurational complexity during installation. Secondly, Debian is renowned for stability, receiving fewer updates meticulously tested for stability, whereas Ubuntu provides access to the latest software and technologies, albeit with potentially less stability.

2. What are the most common environments/platforms Linux is used for? Name three different
environments/platforms and name one distribution you can use for each.

A few of the common environments/platforms would be smartphone, desktop and server. On
smartphones, it can be used by distributions such as Android. On desktop and server, it can be
used by any distribution that is mostly suitable with the functionality of that machine, from
Debian, Ubuntu to CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

3. You are planning to install a Linux distribution in a new environment. Name four things that
you should consider when choosing a distribution.

When choosing a distribution, a few of the main things that should be considered is cost,
performance, scalability, how stable it is and the hardware demand of the system.

4. Name three devices that the Android OS runs on, other than smartphones.

Other devices that Android runs on are smart TVs, tablet computers, Android Auto and
smartwatches.


5. Explain three major advantages of cloud computing.

The major advantages of cloud computing are flexibility, easy to recover and low use cost.
Cloud based services are easy to implement and scale, depending on the business
requirements. It has a major advantage in backup and recovery solutions, as it enables
businesses to recover from incidents faster and with less repercussions. Furthermore, it
reduces operation costs, as it allows to pay just for the resources that a business uses, on a subscription-based model.

6. What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, providing access to a shared pool of configurable resources, including servers, storage, databases, networking, and software. Users can access these resources remotely via the internet from cloud service providers, eliminating the need for owning and maintaining physical hardware. Cloud computing offers flexibility, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of access, enabling businesses and individuals to leverage computing resources on-demand.
