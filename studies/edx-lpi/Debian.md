# The Debian Family

Some key facts about the Debian family are listed below:

The Debian family is upstream for Ubuntu, and Ubuntu is upstream for Linux Mint and others.
Kernel version 5.19 is used in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
It uses the DPKG-based APT package manager (using apt, apt-get, apt-cache, etc., which we cover in detail later) to install, update, and remove packages in the system.
Ubuntu has been widely used for cloud deployments.
While Ubuntu is built on top of Debian and is GNOME-based under the hood, it differs visually from the interface on standard Debian, as well as other distributions.
