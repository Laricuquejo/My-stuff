# The SUSE Family

Some of the key facts about the SUSE family are listed below:

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) is upstream for openSUSE.
Kernel version 5.14 is used in openSUSE Leap 15.4.
It uses the RPM-based zypper package manager (we cover it in detail later) to install, update, and remove packages in the system.
It includes the YaST (Yet Another Setup Tool) application for system administration purposes.
SLES is widely used in retail and many other sectors.
